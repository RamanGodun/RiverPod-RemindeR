/// 📄 **[autoDisposedModeWithSimpleGen] - AutoDispose Provider with Code Generation**
/// - This provider is **autoDisposed**:
///   - It is created when first needed.
///   - It is disposed immediately after no widgets are listening.

/// 🟢 **Use Case:**
/// Ideal for **temporary data/state**, such as:
/// - Loading indicators
/// - Short-lived UI components
/// - Views with frequently changing data

/// ⚙️ **Behavior:**
/// - No caching; resources are freed immediately when not used.
/// - Reduces memory footprint.
